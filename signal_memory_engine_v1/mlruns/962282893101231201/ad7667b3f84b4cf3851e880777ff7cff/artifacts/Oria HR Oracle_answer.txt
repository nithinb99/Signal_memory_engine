Based on the given biometric readings, there is no direct correlation to determine why the person has gone silent after receiving performance feedback. Biometric data such as HRV, temperature, and blink rate may provide insights into physiological responses, but it does not provide a definitive answer to why the person has chosen to remain silent. Additional information or context would be needed to understand the individual's behavior in response to the feedback.
